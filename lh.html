          The EVO design prioritizes aerodynamics, utilizing a front splitter to create a double airway beneath the body
          and new flaps that increase aerodynamic load five times compared to the previous Huracán model, enhancing
          stability during braking, acceleration, and cornering. A newly designed suspended rear spoiler further
          improves aerodynamic efficiency. The V10 aspirated engine, boasting the highest specific power, features
          optimized fluid dynamics in both aspiration and exhaust systems, drawing from Lamborghini Motorsport expertise
          to ensure responsive performance at any speed. The dual-clutch transmission (LDF) is enhanced for peak
          performance, complemented by a dynamic, vibrant exhaust sound.

          The Huracán EVO combines Lamborghini Dynamic Steering and Lamborghini All-Wheel Steering for unparalleled
          dynamic performance. The LDS system adjusts steering based on speed and driving mode, while the LRS system
          manages rear-steering for agility at low speeds and stability at higher speeds. Electronically controlled
          4-wheel drive enhances torque distribution, optimizing control in all conditions. Continuous adaptation based
          on driving mode and road response improves power transfer during sporty driving and enhances traction and
          safety in everyday situations. Overall, the Huracán EVO offers exceptional control and performance across
          various driving scenarios.
